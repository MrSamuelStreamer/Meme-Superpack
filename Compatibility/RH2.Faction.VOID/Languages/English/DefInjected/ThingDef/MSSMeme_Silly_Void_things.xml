	<RH_DF_Titan.label>bacon man</RH_DF_Titan.label>
	<RH_DF_Titan.description>Nerotonin Type-4 variant Bacon man, an enlarged and muscle bound subject with bones protruding out of its body.\n\nThe Bacon man's strength is featured in its ability to run rampant across streets, running through vehicles in its path and losing very little speed to chase after its prey. The N4 strain changed this subject's bones into something stronger if not equal to conk-creet in terms of strength baybee. This effectively makes the Bacon man a living tank, capable of taking many punishing hits before it goes down.\n\nThe N-4 strain allows this subject to crisp up nicely if left in the oven long enough.</RH_DF_Titan.description>

	<RH_DF_BlackTitan.label>burnt bacon man</RH_DF_BlackTitan.label>
	<RH_DF_BlackTitan.description>A weaponized bacon man that has been left in the over a bit too long, the result of a Bacon Man's prolonged exposure to high temperature in a controlled environment.\n\nNotably has a soot-black skin, larger in size and its bones protruding out of its body as a result of its "change". It is significantly faster and stronger than its Titan predecessor, its bones and muscle have adapted to be as hard as those really burnt on bits on the tray. The Nerotonin-4 virus, having been known to survive high temperatures, under the right circumstances could potentially evolve in an attempt to preserve its host. Burnt bacon men were among the most feared abominations within the Fairview Wasteland, very few survivors lived to report sightings in black zones.\n\nDue to how the N-4 virus strain works, this creature is immune to heat damage, though the creature is still vulnerable to heatstrokes.</RH_DF_BlackTitan.description>
