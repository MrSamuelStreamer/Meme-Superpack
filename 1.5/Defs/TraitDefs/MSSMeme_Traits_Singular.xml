				<label>luck of the dwarves</label>
				<description>[PAWN_nameDef] is cursed with terrible luck. [PAWN_pronoun] takes far more damage than the average person should, seems to get ill all the time, and is just generally plagued with all kinds of misfortune. All of this, despite [PAWN_possessive] attempts to cope via stress-eating, obviously has [PAWN_nameDef] on a hair trigger at all times, ready to snap at whatever misfortune life throws at [PAWN_possessive]. At least [PAWN_pronoun] is a VERY fast worker in order to make the most of [PAWN_objective] assuredly short life.\n\nAlso Sam, if you're reading this, I cannot believe you put your best crafter who also had half the HP of a regular pawn in a crappy warcasket.</description>

				<label>Icewolf's fortune</label>
				<description>[PAWN_nameDef] seems to be cursed with a doomed existence. [PAWN_pronoun] seems to nearly die from even the smallest paper cuts, and [PAWN_pronoun] always seems to fall victim to a variety of unfortunate events. It's honestly a miracle that [PAWN_pronoun] even managed to live as long as [PAWN_pronoun] has.</description>

				<label>deranged fan artist</label>
				<description>{PAWN_nameDef} is a fanatical artist constantly enamored with something {PAWN_pronoun} calls "shipping." {PAWN_pronoun} is especially obsessed with "shipping" characters in a certain fictional universe, to the point of an almost constant mental breakdown. But once {PAWN_pronoun} finally breaks, {PAWN_nameDef} has the uncanny ability to create frighteningly high quality items.</description>

				<description>Hmm, what should I draw? A Petal x Anne piece I saw earlier has inspired me, so perhaps some classic Panne art? Some steamy Elon x Asimov yaoi art would also be good. But what if... Maria Chunk and 49? Mayhaps some Slush x Maxima (#JusticeForSlush)? Buggsy x Buggo is unconventional, yet has great potential. Corpo dommy mommy Frog is an excellent choice as well though. I could draw Cremebrulee, a waifu gone too soon. Or maybe I could even draw Arcadius and the rest of the Deadly Sins (but especially Arcadius)? ARRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGH, I CAN'T DECIDE! THEY'RE ALL SO HOT!!!</description>
